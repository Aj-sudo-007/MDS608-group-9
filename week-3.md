Task#1 : Legal Protections: The Corporations Act 2001 in Australia provides legal protections for whistleblowers who meet certain criteria. 
It's important to understand these protections before taking any action.
Documentation: It's crucial to document all observations, communications, and attempts to address the concerns internally. This documentation can be essential if further action is required.
Seek Legal Advice: Whistleblowing can be complex. It's advisable to seek legal advice from an expert in employment law and whistleblowing to understand your rights and obligations.
Task#2 he Primary Ethical Issues

Confidentiality (ACS Code 1.2): Jordan has a duty to maintain the confidentiality of XYZMart's data. Sharing any information, even seemingly "non-specific" insights, could breach this duty. The data allows identifying individual habits, which is sensitive information.
Competence and Integrity (ACS Code 1.3): Jordan should act with professional competence and integrity. This includes being honest with both XYZMart and Taylor, and not misrepresenting the nature of their work or the information they possess.
Conflicts of Interest (ACS Code 1.5): Taylor's offer creates a potential conflict of interest. Jordan's personal gain (career advancement) could influence their professional judgment and potentially lead to actions that harm XYZMart.
