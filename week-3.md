Task#1 : Legal Protections: The Corporations Act 2001 in Australia provides legal protections for whistleblowers who meet certain criteria. 
It's important to understand these protections before taking any action.
Documentation: It's crucial to document all observations, communications, and attempts to address the concerns internally. This documentation can be essential if further action is required.
Seek Legal Advice: Whistleblowing can be complex. It's advisable to seek legal advice from an expert in employment law and whistleblowing to understand your rights and obligations.
