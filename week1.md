Task 3: 1. A data scientist trying to learn web development.
Evaluation: Medium
Reason: Web development isn't a core requirement for most data science roles. Many data scientists work primarily with data analysis, modeling, and statistical tools.
2.A data scientist trying to switch to a machine learning engineer by learning how to code in PyTorch.
Evaluation: High
Reason: PyTorch is one of the most popular and powerful deep learning frameworks. It's essential for building, training, and deploying sophisticated machine learning models,
especially those involving neural networks. Machine learning engineers use PyTorch extensively in their daily work.
Machine learning engineers are in high demand. By demonstrating proficiency in PyTorch, a data scientist significantly increases their chances of landing a machine learning engineering role.
3. A data scientist applying for a master's in finance.
Evaluation:  Medium to High (depending on the goal)
Reason: Rationale: This evaluation depends on the data scientist's specific career goals.
High: If the goal is to work in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, or a field where financial expertise is crucial, 
then a master's in finance is highly valuable. It provides in-depth knowledge of financial markets, modeling, and risk management.
Medium: If the goal is to generally broaden their knowledge and potentially move into a more business-oriented role within their current field,
it can be beneficial. However, it might not be as directly applicable as other CPD options.
Task 4: Missed Deadline
Commitment: The team failed to demonstrate a high standard of commitment by not delivering the software on time.
Even with unforeseen challenges, proactive communication and potential renegotiation of the deadline could have shown a greater commitment to the client's needs.
Integrity: While there might not be a direct breach of integrity, a lack of transparency about potential delays could be seen as a lack of forthrightness.
Responsibility: The team bears responsibility for the missed deadline and the client's financial losses. They are accountable for fulfilling the terms of the contract.
Accountability: The team needs to acknowledge their failure to meet the deadline and take appropriate steps to mitigate the client's losses. This might involve offering compensation or revised terms for future work.
